- MongoDB database connection and containerization
- Repository Pattern Implementation
- Swagger Open API implementation

Basket Service
- ASP.NET Web API application
- REST API principles, CRUD operations
- Redis database connection and containerization
- Consume Discount Grpc Service for inter-service sync communication to calculate product final price
- Publish BasketCheckout Queue with using MassTransit and RabbitMQ

Discount Service
- ASP.NET Grpc Server application
- Build a Highly Performant inter-service gRPC Communication with Basket Microservice
- Exposing Grpc Services with creating Protobuf messages
- Using Dapper for micro-orm implementation to simplify data access and ensure high performance
- PostgreSQL database connection and containerization

Microservices Communication
- Sync inter-service gRPC Communication
- Async Microservices Communication with RabbitMQ Message-Broker Service
- Using RabbitMQ Publish/Subscribe Topic Exchange Model
- Using MassTransit for abstraction over RabbitMQ Message-Broker system
- Publishing BasketCheckout event queue from Basket microservices and Subscribing this event from Ordering microservices
- Create RabbitMQ EventBus.Messages library and add references Microservices

Ordering Service
- Implementing DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture with using Best Practices
- Developing CQRS with using MediatR, FluentValidation and AutoMapper packages
- Consuming RabbitMQ BasketCheckout event queue with using MassTransit-RabbitMQ Configuration
- SqlServer database connection and containerization
- Using Entity Framework Core ORM and auto migrate to SqlServer when application startup

API Gateway Ocelot Service
- Implement API Gateways with Ocelot
- Sample microservices/containers to reroute through the API Gateways
- Run multiple different API Gateway/BFF container types
- The Gateway aggregation pattern in Shopping.Aggregator

Web Client
- ASP.NET Core Web Application with Bootstrap 4 and Razor template
- Call Ocelot APIs with HttpClientFactory
- ASPNET Core Razor Tools â€” View Components, partial Views, Tag Helpers, Model Bindings and Validations, Razor Sections etc.

Microservices Cross-Cutting Implementations
- Implementing Centralized Distributed Logging with Elastic Stack (ELK); Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and SeriLog for Microservices
- Use the HealthChecks feature in back-end ASP.NET microservices
- Using Watchdog in separate service that can watch health and load across services, and report health about the microservices by querying with the HealthChecks

Microservices Resilience Implementations
- Making Microservices more resilient Use IHttpClientFactory to implement resilient HTTP requests
- Implement Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns with exponential backoff with IHttpClientFactory and Polly policies
